# PHP-DEV templates

This folder and the files within are for designers to get started rapidly without
needing a developer to setup the action hooks.

Any HTML added to these files needs to be moved to production ready files
before going live with the theme.

This folder needs to be deleted before going live.

See more in the root level README.md file.
