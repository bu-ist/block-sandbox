# Common Elements

Blocks in a large plugin often share some elements that are not a
gutenberg block themselves but use the same styles and markup. For
example a taxonomy term "label" that is styled like a pillbox and
might appear on top of a thumbnail. Or a consistent style for buttons,
headings, etc.

These can be written here so that the styles don't have to replicated
multiple times in each block's stylesheet.
