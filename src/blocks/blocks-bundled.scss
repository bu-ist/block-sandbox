/**
* This file imports all of the base frontend styles for each block
* in order to create a final compiled stylesheet that contains all
* non-shared block frontend CSS. This lets us enqueue all of the block
* styles together when desired.
*
* Note: each block also compiles it's block styles into a block specific
* stylesheet for the frontend. This allows us to have the option to instead
* load block styles as separate stylesheets for each block. A use case would
* be for a project where most of the blocks are disabled, or in the future
* when we support HTTP/2 and decide to switch to multiple small stylesheets
* instead of a large one. Future versions of WordPress are also adding the ability
* to inline CSS as well as load core blocks as individual stylesheets when they
* are used on the page.
