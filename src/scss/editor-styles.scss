// The following Block Editor styles are added to the block editor thru add_theme_support() with 
// the the add_editor_style() function. In doing so they are prepended with the .editor-styles-wrapper 
// class so as to only affect contents within the block editor and create pairity between the frontend 
// and the editor. And so any partials imported to theme.scss which affect the content area and blocks 
// there within should also be added to this sheet in a similar order.
